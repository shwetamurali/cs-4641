				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					<i>
						discussing the problem you aim to address, your motivation and goal
					</i>
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					This project aims to address the problem of selecting which parts of a
					virus's protein shell can be used to create a vaccine. Instead of
					manually searching for and testing each <i>epitope</i> &mdash; a
					region of the protein sequence &mdash; individually, vaccine
					developers would use this model to narrow down their options to only
					those epitopes most likely to produce an immune response.
				</p>
				[Image here?]
				<p>
					This should speed up the process of determining which protein
					sequences should be synthesized and tested as a vaccine in clinical
					trials. The motivation is that with quicker time to clinical trials
					and a higher liklihood of those trials producing a functional vaccine,
					vaccines for new contagions can be produced more quickly, potentially
					saving lives.

				<h2>Methods</h2>
				<p>
					<i>
						outlining the dataset you are planning on utilizing and the
						techniques you intend to apply
					</i>
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					We intend to use the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/futurecorporation/epitope-prediction">COVID-19/SARS B-cell Epitope Prediction</a>
					database derived from <a href = "https://www.iedb.org/">IEDB</a>
					and <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/">UniProt</a>.&nbsp
					This database contains 14 features of 14907 epitopes divided
					into general B-Cells and SARS.&nbsp It also contains 13 features of
					20305 COVID-19 epitopes which we will label with antibody valence during
					the supervised phase of our project.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					For the unsupervised learning phase of our project, we intend to perform
					feature engineering through two approaches.&nbsp First clustering our data using
					clustering algorithms such as KMeans, GMM, and DBScan.&nbsp We will then perform
					clustering analysis to determine the efficacy of each approach for our dataset.&nbsp
					This can help us find underlying similarities in our data which can
					help us determine which features are important for predicting vaccine candidacy.&nbsp
					Second, we will use Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality
					of our data as appropriate.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					For the supervised learning phase of our project, we plan to use an ensemble of weak
					learners such as random forests and decision trees along with a neural network in order
					to predict antibody valence (and thus vaccine efficacy) given a protein sequence and relevant
					features.&nbsp We will split our labeled data into a training and testing set to accomplish this,
					however, ultimately we intend to classify the unlabelled COVID-19 Epitopes.

				<h2>Discussion</h2>
                <p>
                    <i>
						    explaining what would be the best outcome, what it would mean, what is next, etc.
				    </i>
                </p>
                <br />
				<p>
					
						Our ideal output would be a model that predicts the antibody valence of a given protein sequence and relavant traits of the protein. 
                        We aim to narrow down the list of epitopes to test for the vaccine of COVID-19 or similar strains of the virus
                        by optimizing our model to dismiss false negatives.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        With a successful model, scientists and vaccine manufacturers gain a deeper insight into immune responses to COVID-19 and similar strains of the virus.
                        In turn, this results in a faster development of COVID-19 vaccine, and future vaccines of similar viruses. 
                        As vaccines are essential for immunity against the virus, this model can in turn eliminate the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
