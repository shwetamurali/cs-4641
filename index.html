				<h2>Review</h2>
				<p>
					The data we'll be using comes from three seperate datasets with the same features.
					Each entry in the datasets is a separate <i>epitope</i>, which is a region of the
					protein shell of a virus. The features of the dataset are an assortment of chemical
					properties of each epitope. Which virus the epitope is from is precisely the
					difference between the three datasets: we have a large, labeled general dataset for
					"B-Cell" epitopes, which refers	a collection of many miscellanious viruses. There is
					a smaller labeled dataset for SARS, which is a virus closely related to COVID-19,
					and then we have a large but unlabeled dataset for COVID-19. The labels are for
					"antibody valency"; a valent epitope can be used as a vaccine, while a nonvalent
					epitope cannot. So, the task is to use the features of each epitope in the labeled
					datasets to build a model which can predict the antibody valencies for COVID-19 epitopes.

				<h2>Clustering Evaluation</h2>
				<p>
					One simple statistic we can look at to begin evaluating the
					clustering models is the number of data points in each cluster.
					This does not imply correctness or incorrectness, but can tell us
					the sizes of each group.
				</p>
				<img src="assets/midterm/clusterpointsbcell.png" />
				<img src="assets/midterm/clusterpointssars.png" />
				<img src="assets/midterm/clusterpointscovid.png" />
				<p>
					The clusters' sizes are fairly even between the B-Cell and COVID-19
					epitopes, but half of the SARS clusters are much smaller than the others.
					This is interesting but does not necessarily mean anything. SARS is also
					the smallest dataset, so the uneven cluster sizes might be caused by that.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					We have ground truth labels for the B-Cell and SARS epitopes, so we can
					compare the total number of valent and nonvalent epitopes in each cluster.
					With those totals, we can also calculate purity for the clusters: the
					portion of data points in that cluster which belong to that cluster's
					most numerous ground truth label.
				</p>
				<img src="assets/midterm/valentbcell.png" />
				<img src="assets/midterm/puritybcell.png" />
				<p>
					For the B-Cell clusters, the purities range from about 0.65 to about 0.85.
					This might seem decent initially because a purity of 1 is a perfect match
					between clustering assignment and ground truth label. However, every cluster
					is matching with the same label (nonvalent) and the portion of nonvalent
					epitopes in the whole B-Cell dataset is about 0.75 (indicated with the red
					dashed line). That means that the cluster assignments are more or less a
					random sampling with regard to the ground truth label.
				</p>
				<img src="assets/midterm/valentsars.png" />
				<img src="assets/midterm/puritysars.png" />
				<p>
					Unlike the B-Cell clusters, there are two clusters in the SARS model which
					match with the valent ground truth label. One of them even has a purity of
					1! Unfortunately, those are also the two smallest clusters, so they aren't
					very useful for the majority of the data points. Among the remaining clusters,
					we observe the same trend as the B-Cell data: each cluster has a roughly random
					sample of valent and nonvalent datapoints. These observations lead us to believe
					that clustering is insufficent for building the desired model to classify epitopes
					and that we will need to utilize supervised learning to achieve better results.
